# Memory-game
Here I learn to call classes in the DOM, flip cards and work with boolean values.

##  The Mission

We want to recreate the game memory. It is a game where you have a bunch of cards. Each card contains an image. Of each image there are exactly two cards. The cards are placed in a random order. You get to turn them around. If you turned around two cards they either turn back so you can't see their image if they did not match. And if they did match they stay image face visible.

###  Must-have features

-  [x] Clicking cards turns them around
-  [x] Randomly position the cards
-  [x] Readme, but that shouldn't even have to be said
-  [x] Explanation on the page itself

##  The Game

### The Plot

This memory game is made in the style of 'The Werewolves of Millers Hollow'. In this game we find ourselves in the otherwise peaceful village of Millers Hollow, however something is amiss. At innocent villagers turn to werewolves and murder the other innocent villagers in an attempt to take over the village. The villagers decide to act against these mysterious murders.

### How to play

In this game you try to make pairs like in 'Memory'. By doing so you kill the pair you matched. In the village there are 3 werewolves, try to find them all before you kill all your innocent villagers!
